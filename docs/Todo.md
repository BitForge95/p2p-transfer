TODO : 

1 - Implement sha-512 for hashing the seeder and also the tracker while seeding or leaching the .torrent file
2 - Implement Super Seeding for the peers who are uploading a new file/piece.
3 - Implement anti snubbing to prevent the client with low download rates from being ignored and optimistically unchoke the client
